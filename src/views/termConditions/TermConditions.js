                provisions will remain in effect and will be construed in
                accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal
                provision were not contained herein. Sponsor’s failure to
                enforce any term of these Official Rules will not constitute a
                waiver of that provision. When terms such as "may" are used in
                these Official Rules, Sponsor has sole and absolute discretion.
                Applicants agree to waive any rights to claim ambiguity of these
                Official Rules. Headings are solely for convenience of reference
                and will not be deemed to affect in any manner the meaning or
                intent of the documents or any provision hereof. In the event
                there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or
                other statements contained in any Awards-Program-related
                materials, privacy policy, or terms of use on Sponsor’s Website
                and/or the terms and conditions of the Official Rules, the
                Official Rules shall prevail, govern, and control, and the
                discrepancy will be resolved in Sponsor’s sole and absolute
                discretion.
